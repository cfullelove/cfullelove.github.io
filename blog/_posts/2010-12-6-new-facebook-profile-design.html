<div data-src="v5"><p style="text-align: justify;">In the last few days <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>&nbsp;has been rolling out a new<em>&nbsp;profile page </em>design. It&#8217;s supposed to give the Facebook user a better overview of a person&#8217;s profile as well as adding a few new features.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One thing I love is that those stupid &#8220;tabs&#8221; or &#8220;boxes&#8221; seem to have disappeared. So a Facebook profile page now looks much cleaner and more elegant.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can read more in-depth reports about the ins and outs on the <a href="http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=462201327130">Facebook Blog</a> and <a href="http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-technology/facebook-founder-rolls-out-changes-to-profile-pages-20101206-18lrm.html">this article in the Sydney Morning Herald</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Interestingly, this new design is opt in. Meaning that you can choose to use it or just stay the same. There is a considerable amount of&nbsp;commentary&nbsp;about how this is quite out of character for Facebook&#8230;who usually force changes on its users. Is Facebook learning? Is it mistake not to force improvements on users?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you do want to give it a shot, go to this url: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/about/profile">http://www.facebook.com/about/profile</a>&nbsp;(Keep in mind that its a one way thing - no going back - like taking the &#8220;red pill&#8221;)&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To give you a quick visual on the changes, here is a screen cap of my profile (view when I&#8217;m logged in) and my brother&#8217;s profile - to show you how others&#8217; profiles will look like.</p>

<p>Will be interesting to see if this new design catches on. Please feel free to share your thoughts!</p>
