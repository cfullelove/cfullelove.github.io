<div data-src="v5"><p><br /><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="AppStore.jpg" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50616230c4aaf3a25087208f/50616266e4b09bed8049ae97/50616267e4b09bed8049af6f/1294565310067/#img.jpg.6 - brings with it a new way to discover and purchase Mac applications (&#8220;apps&#8221;). The Mac App Store is the most recent extension to the iTunes Music and iOS App Store concept that has been so very successful.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There has been quite a deal of discussion on whether or not the Mac App Store is a good thing for the Mac &#8220;ecosystem&#8221; (sorry for the buzz word).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some has suggested that the store signals an attempt by Apple to be the gatekeepers in terms of what software is allowed to be installed on your Mac computer - similar to how it restricts the iOS applications. Personally, I don&#8217;t really buy that.The other theory, is that the Mac App Store merely adds a new place to get applications. More, it is attempting to cater for the less tech-savvy user and simplify the process of finding, purchasing, and installing Apps.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Apple hasn&#8217;t restricted the your ability to install applications just as you always have - something that differs from the iOS situation. In fact, you can easily get away with ignoring the App Store completely. So in my mind the App Store is an added feature rather than a sign of a future &#8220;closed&#8221; OS (though if Apple does make a move to restrict the installation of non-AppStore applications, there would be a <strong>massive </strong>backlash).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now, enough about the conspiracy theories. For anyone familiar with the iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad App Store (ie, just about everyone) the experience offered by the Mac App Store will be very familiar.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Featured.png" src="{{ site.path }}/assets/2011-1-9-the-mac-app-store/1294565330217.png" width="550" height="444" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The screencap above shows the &#8220;Featured&#8221; section of the Mac App Store. You can see that it really does look a lot like the iTunes Music or iOS App stores.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When you attempt to purchase or download an App for the first time, you will be asked for you iTunes account information, and asked to verify your payment details. Fairly standard procedure.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Purchases.png" src="{{ site.path }}/assets/2011-1-9-the-mac-app-store/1294565334025.png" width="550" height="152" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you have purchased an App, it will &#8220;float&#8221; onto your Dock where you can see the progress of the download and installation. Once it has been installed, the App&#8217;s icon will bounce a few times, and you can run it. The App&#8217;s icon will remain in the Dock unless you remove it by dragging it elsewhere (find it again in the Applications folder). You can also see the applications you&#8217;ve purchased in the &#8220;Purchases&#8221; section. If you have more than one Mac, you will be able to see and download Apps you have purchased on other machines. This can be seen in the image above.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Top Free.png" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50616230c4aaf3a25087208f/50616266e4b09bed8049ae97/50616267e4b09bed8049af72/1294565340953/#img.png" width="550" height="319" /><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Top Paid.png" src="{{ site.path }}/assets/2011-1-9-the-mac-app-store/1294565347803.png" width="550" height="320" /></p>
<p>As you can see above, the Mac App Store has the familiar charts ranking the Top Free, Paid and Grossing Apps.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Categories.png" src="{{ site.path }}/assets/2011-1-9-the-mac-app-store/1294565356627.png" width="550" height="444" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like the other stores, the Mac App Store has a bunch of familiar categories to browse through in your search for Apps. I should point out that in my browsing I noticed that, for the moment at least, there really aren&#8217;t all that many Apps available. But I expect this to change in the relatively near future.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So that&#8217;s the Mac App Store. Aside from the fact that you should get it whether you like it or not while diligently keeping your system up to date, I&#8217;m not going to suggest everyone go and dive in straight away. I think the store has quite a deal of potential, but for now I think that most people will be underwhelmed with the number of available apps - even with the inclusion of Angry Birds!</p>
