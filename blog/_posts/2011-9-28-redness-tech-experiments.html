<div data-src="v5"><p>Some of you may know that in addition to my normal day-to-day job, I run a very small (and very low revenue) business. The business is called <a href="http://rednesstech.com">Redness Tech</a>, and it&#8217;s current primary activity is the operation of a web-based roster management system - <a href="http://rednesstech.com/rtms.php">Redness Tech Roster Management System (RTRMS)</a>. This is actually the same product I referred to in my recent blog post <a href="/blog/2011/8/28/some-interesting-websites.html">Search for a Business Partner</a> - I haven&#8217;t had many hits on that either, sadly.</p>
<p>In an effort to get a better face on the business and the product, I have recently been experimenting with getting logos and web design by way of outsourcing. While I do hope that these efforts may translate into some more business, I&#8217;m mostly doing this for a little bit of fun and curiosity. The reason I am outsourcing these activities is because I just don&#8217;t have the time or energy to do it all myselfâ€¦ and that I don&#8217;t have some of the skill required.</p>
<p>So what have I done? Firstly, I&#8217;ve updated the Redness Tech logo from this:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="oldlogo.png" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50616230c4aaf3a25087208f/50616266e4b09bed8049ae97/50616267e4b09bed8049afab/1317206579577/#img.png" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50616230c4aaf3a25087208f/50616266e4b09bed8049ae97/50616267e4b09bed8049afac/1317207229337/#img.png">here</a> - and please let me know your thoughts in the comments.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also experimenting with outsourcing some of the web design for the Roster Management System. This hasn&#8217;t been quite as successful, I think due to language barriers (most of the contractors are Indian) and possibly vague instructions. Time will tell, and at the very least it will be a learning experience.</p>
<p>So how has this &#8220;outsourcing&#8221; actually being done? Let me introduce you to <a href="http://elance.com">Elance</a>. Elance is a marketplace for trading services - you can post up jobs for free and allow contractors (who have to pay) to bid on that job. The type of jobs range from <em>virtual assistants </em>to <em>web design</em> to <em>legal</em> etc. What I am learning quite quickly, however, is that while you can get things done very cheaply sometimes, you do get what you pay for&#8230;</p>
<p>If you have a little bit of money lying around and are curious, I seriously suggest trying something like this.</p></div>
