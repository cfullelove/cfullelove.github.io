<div data-src="v5"><p>Recently, I managed to get a gas hotplate working in our kitchen. It&#8217;s nothing fancy - a two-ring camping hotplate fed from a normal gas bottle. But having this new grunt in the kitchen has sparked a bit of creativity and adventure on the&nbsp;culinary&nbsp;front.</p>
<p>On a weekly basis I download the <a href="http://revision3.com/foodmob">Food Mob!</a> podcast from the <a href="http://revision3.com">Revision3</a>&nbsp;network. It&#8217;s a pretty new show, with less than 15 or so episodes, but it really appeals to my style of cooking. Hosted Chef Niall Harbison,&nbsp;Food Mob focuses on quick and simple&nbsp;recipes that also taste really good (I know because I have tried making a few of them!).</p>
<p>One of the Food Mob episodes covered how to make <a href="http://revision3.com/bites/friedmarsbar">Deep Fried Mars Bars</a>. One of the really cool things about my new gas hotplate that I now have the ability to deep fry things&#8230; I think you can see where this is going. But, wanting to have a bit more fun, I expanded my range to include a few other chocolate bars&#8230; Here are the results:</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">There were a few others tried, but I remembered too late to start taking photos. KitKat was my favourite&#8230;Mmm&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It should also be known that I didn&#8217;t eat these all by myself - shockingly, I had quite a few other interested taste testers in the house!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you are interested in trying this out for yourself, go to the Food Mob page on the Revision 3 website, or follow this <a href="http://revision3.com/bites/friedmarsbar">link</a>.&nbsp;Please leave comments below!</p>
