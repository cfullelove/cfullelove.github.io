<div data-src="v5"><p style="text-align: justify;">Some people may have noticed the new page that appeared on this site a few days ago called &#8220;My Books&#8221;. You can see the link up with rest at the top of this page. I am now posting the titles and authors of all the books that I read or listen to. The hope is that the list will inspire people to read some of them too.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">See my books <a href="/my-books/">here</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is a facility to comment on each book too - something I hope some people will use!</p></div>
