<div data-src="v5"><p>I had the pleasure of going for a decent half-day road trip to <a href="http://maps.google.com.au/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;sll=-28.342514,152.371699&amp;sspn=0.014428,0.027852&amp;gl=au&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hnear=&amp;t=h&amp;ll=-28.337248,152.367282&amp;spn=0.014429,0.027852&amp;z=16">Queen Mary Falls</a>&nbsp;this weekend. It&#8217;s a truly beautiful part of Southern Queensland - just about the NSW border.</p>
<p>Sadly, the trip was on somewhat of a whim, so I didn&#8217;t have a decent camera. But my HTC Desire did manage to take <em>some </em>passable shots.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">This photo shows off the countryside and the weather on the day.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">All in all, it was a fantastic drive. I saw hundreds of cows, some horses and a few wallabies (and managed <em>not</em>&nbsp;to hit any either). If you are looking to get away from the stress of the next few weeks, I recommend going somewhere like this.</p></div>
