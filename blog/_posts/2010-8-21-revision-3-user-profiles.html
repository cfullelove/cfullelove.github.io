<div data-src="v5"><p>The Internet TV site <a href="http://rev3.com">Revision3</a>&nbsp;has recently introduced user profiles. I&#8217;ve only just signed up, so I don&#8217;t know all of the features yet, but there is some really cool stuff included.</p>
<p>The structure seems to be very &#8220;social mediaish&#8221; - ie it gives you a public profile (<a href="http://revision3.com/user/cfullelove">here&#8217;s mine</a>)&nbsp;and allows you to follow other users. All very cool I think. Its kinda like a niche Youtube.</p>
<p>Another really cool feature that I am excited about is the ability to create a custom feed of Rev3 shows I like. You can see an my setup below:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="full-image-block ssNonEditable"><span><img style="width: 400px;" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50616230c4aaf3a25087208f/50616266e4b09bed8049ae97/50616267e4b09bed8049af47/1282377187005/#img.png</em></p>
<p>If you happen to share my taste in Revision3 shows you can use <a href="http://revision3.com/feed/user/7adfdfee3419ce31">this link</a> to get a feed of my favourites. I use this link to subscribe to my favourite shows in iTunes. But I would also encourage you to go and create an account yourself and have a look around to see if any of the shows interest you.</p>
<p>I am a big fan of Revision3 and their shows. Most of the shows are released on a weekly basis, but there are some that have smaller more frequent releases. I really like their style of production and the fact that everything is freely available for download or streaming. Even their sponsors are decent! (though perhaps a little&nbsp;repetitive)</p>
<p>These are the shows I watch on a semi-regular basis.</p>
