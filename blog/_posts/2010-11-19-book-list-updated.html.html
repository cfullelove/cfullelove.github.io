<div data-src="v5"><p>I have finally got around to updating the <a href="/my-books/">My Books</a> page to include all of my recently read books. I think I added around 9 or 10&#8230; So I was a little behind on posting them up.</p>
<p>Some really good books in the mix though. Most&nbsp;notably for me, the Daniel Suarez novels Daemon and Freedom (TM) were fantastic. These books resonated with me on a deep nerdy level, but I think &nbsp;that they would be very interesting for anyone. I mean, who wouldn&#8217;t find a daemon written by a dead guy running the world?</p>
<p>Anyway, I encourage you to have a look at the new additions. Keen to listen to comments anyone has..</p></div>
