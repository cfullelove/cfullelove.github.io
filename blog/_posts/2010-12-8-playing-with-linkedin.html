<div data-src="v5"><p><a href="http://www.linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a> is basically social networking for the professional. It allows for users to connect with each other on a professional level, leaving the drunken party photos and bogan friend comments to other services like Facebook.</p>

<p>I have always stayed away from LinkedIn because I didn&#8217;t really have a use for it - mainly because I have never been a professional. Recently, however, I realised that I kinda do qualify as a professional - I work at a real corporate entity as a professional officer (engineer). So I signed up.</p>
<p>First impressions were not far from what I expected. The interface definitely isn&#8217;t built to please the greater public. It basic, bare, and not very cuddly like a Facebook or Twitter. But then it isn&#8217;t supposed to be.</p>
<p>It does do some things quite well. It handles the input of detailed employment history, contact information, Education details, etc quite well. It almost allows you to build a stripped down resume, but then - because its a social network - allows you to share your profile with colleges, friends and associates.</p>
<p>Apparently, the use of LinkedIn isn&#8217;t as limited as some might believe. I noticed that quite a number of people I know professionally or otherwise use the service. In fact some use the service because its <em>expected</em>&nbsp;- not just because they want to.</p>
<p>For those who are interested, my LinedIn profile can be found <a href="http://au.linkedin.com/in/chrisfullelove">here</a>. Or a much prettier version (through <a href="http://flavors.me">Flavors.me</a>) <a href="http://flavors.me/cfullelove#0b7/linkedin">here</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m quite interested to see how I use LinedIn in the near future. Perhaps I might be able to do some serious networking, perhaps even help me in the search for further employment&#8230; In any case I will definitely post again should anything interesting come of its use.</p>
<p>Do you use LinedIn? What are your thoughts experiences with it? Comment below&#8230;</p></div>
