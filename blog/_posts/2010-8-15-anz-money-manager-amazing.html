<p style="text-align: left;">Unfortunately in Australia we aren&#8217;t always privy to new and exciting products being launched elsewhere in other countries. One example of this is the Free Online Finance Manager service, <a href="http://www.mint.com">Mint</a>. Basically what Mint does is monitor various accounts you own, giving you the ability to keep track and better manage your finances. This is something I&#8217;m quite interested in, but I haven&#8217;t been able to try it out because I live in Australia. Now I do realise that some people have had some small success getting <em>some</em>&nbsp;Australian accounts to work, but it really isn&#8217;t a great solution. However, in my wanderings through the interweb I stumbled upon a really fantastic service offered by ANZ bank - <a href="http://www.anzmoneymanager.com">ANZ Money Manager</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">ANZ Money Manager is a very cool service. For starters, it free. Even better, you don&#8217;t require an ANZ bank account to sign up. I have only been using it for a few days, but I&#8217;ll attempt to give a run down of its capabilities and features.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="thumbnail-image-block ssNonEditable"><span><a href="javascript:Y.Squarespace.Utils.lightboxAsset('50616267e4b09bed8049af35');"><img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50616230c4aaf3a25087208f/50616266e4b09bed8049ae97/50616267e4b09bed8049af32/1280485357373/#img.jpg. I have a rule that when &#8220;UTE REPAYMENT&#8221; is found in a transaction description, it is added to the &#8220;Automotive Expenses&#8221; category.&nbsp;Once you are happy with categories of you transactions you are ready to take advantage of the rest of the ANZ Money Manager features - its all about the stats.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">As you might guess from the above image, the ANZ Money Manager allows you to set spending goals and budgets. It will even notify you if you come close to surpassing the thresholds you set - a handy feature in my case.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The ANZ Money Manager offer a wide range of other statistics and features, most of which I haven&#8217;t had the chance to explore yet. But, like any product, there are a few things I don&#8217;t quite like about the Money Manager. Firstly, I&#8217;m really not the biggest fan of the interface. While it&#8217;s not horrible, it could do a little more to make it that bit more intuitive to use. My other main annoyance was the realisation that the categories aren&#8217;t as customisable as I&#8217;d hoped. You are provided with an extensive list of predefined categories, but you aren&#8217;t able to create new ones. You are able to rename them though&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">While the ANZ Money Manager does has a few short comings, you really need to keep in mind that fact that it&#8217;s <em>free</em>. Not only that, you can add virtually any account you feel like to it without the need to be tied to ANZ (so far as I can see anyway). And the statistics and other features the service offers really are good, and help you better view and manage your finances. I commend ANZ for bringing out such a great service and I would recommend that you check it out.</p></div>
