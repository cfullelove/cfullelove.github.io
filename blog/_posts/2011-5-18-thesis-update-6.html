<div data-src="v5"><p>Another update on Thesis progress. Biggest thing to happen was my PCBs arriving. You can see them in the first picture.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="IMG_2914.jpg" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50616230c4aaf3a25087208f/50616266e4b09bed8049ae97/50616267e4b09bed8049af98/1305727084005/#img.jpg" width="500" height="281" /></p>
<p>The top board is is one that I can mount all components on, and the second board is much more compact and doesn't have room for the wireless modem to be mounted directly. The second one if the one I'll be focusing on more as it is slightly better designed and requires less components.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="thesis_monitor.jpg" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50616230c4aaf3a25087208f/50616266e4b09bed8049ae97/50616267e4b09bed8049af99/1305727042077/#img.jpg" width="500" height="281" /></p>
<p>This shows the the smaller PCB after the first round of soldering. This was a fairly gruelling experience due to some design oversights. First, one of my surface mount components was a bit too wide for its footprint, and second, I had mistakenly designed one pin of my current sensor chips to be connected to ground instead of be floating.</p>
<p>The boards are both designed to have two voltage and two current monitoring channels that are all isolatable through the use of jumpers. This means that if I do something stupid with one and it blows up (a pretty likely occurrence) I can still use the alternative channel without having to do up a whole new board. (This point will take up a section in my Thesis about "Redundant Design" or something...) The dodgy looking yellow wire that can be seen is bridging a break in the active power line that due to a lack of a second current sensor.</p>
<p>Below are some photos of the board as it stands now.</p>

<p>Please let me know what you think.</p>
<p>Also, here is a quick video of it in action.</p>
