<div data-src="v5"><p><img class='iphone-image' src='{{ site.path }}/assets/2011-2-7-new-house-actual-3-mobile-reception/1297112856443.jpg'/></p>I recently moved out of home and, among other far more important reasons, one of the reasons I was looking forward to moving out was that I might be able to find a house where my mobile phone actually got reception!

I am a user of the 3 network. Up until recently I hated it because, at my old house, I couldn't get reception in my room - much less data.

Having just moved in to my new house, it's a different story. I am much closer to the city, and not only do I have full reception (full bars), I have really good data speeds. Data rate is important to me because I use my phone for downloading podcasts, email, twitter, browsing etc. I also share my phones Internet with my iPad which is much nicer to use when speeds are higher. Most important, at least for now, is that I have no other option until we get ADSL installed at the new house.

The results of the SpeedTest app running on my iPad using my phones Internet is shown above. 

What sort of speeds do you get through your phone? What carrier are you with?</div>
