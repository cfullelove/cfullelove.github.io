<div data-src="v5"><p>No video this time. Reason being, due to impending deadlines, I have to really get moving on the written portion of my Thesis - you know, the document equivalent to a whole course&#8230;</p>
<p>To that end, I have decided to take a transparent approach to some parts of my written assessment. For alot of the preliminary work - and perhaps more if successful - I am going to be using Google Docs. This allows me to work without the fear of loosing anything, but more importantly it allows me to give anyone the ability to view my progress in real time. I am hoping that if anyone is interested and spots something that can be improved, changed, removed or added, they can let me know.</p>
<p>I have two documents so far going:</p>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/fullelove_thesis_outline">Thesis Outline</a> - this is the outline for my thesis, it is pretty high level at the moment, but I hope to get it much more detailed in the future.</p>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/fullelove_thesis_abstract">Abstract</a> - this is the abstract for my thesis. It is supposed to be written and submitted by 13-May-11. Though I suspect it will change after this submission date.</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>Added Thesis Poster</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/present/edit?id=0AVvJRa0OFprHZGR0NGZmYjhfMTVnY21kZnpjeg&amp;hl=en&amp;authkey=CKTT4IsE">Project Poster</a></p>
<p>Please feel free to give feedback on this approach. To be clear, I don&#8217;t expect people to drop everything and come to my aid. Even if no one actually contributes, the fact that my progress is public will at the very least serve as motivation!</p>
<p><em>More videos in the next post hopefully</em></p></div>
