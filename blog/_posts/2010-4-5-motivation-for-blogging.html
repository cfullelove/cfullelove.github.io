<div data-src="v5"><p><div style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: verdana;">I have wanted to start a blog for quite along time. However, I never really thought I would have enough to talk about, or the skills to do so. In actual fact those that know me would probably say I still don't have the skills... But I do now have things to talk about, so I'm going to give it a try.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: verdana;"><br/></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: verdana;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: verdana;">Firstly, I should probably give a little bit of background on myself. I am a 22 year old student studying Electrical Engineering at the </span><a href="http://www.uq.edu.au/"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: verdana;">University of Queensland in Australia</span></a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: verdana;">. I enjoy, for the most part, what I study, though I am rather easily distracted. One such distraction led to my interest in the hospitality industry. I have worked in a </span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: verdana;"><a href="http://http//www.pizzacapers.com">Pizza Capers</a></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: verdana;">&nbsp;store for the last three years, and for most of the last two years I have served as a manager and Tech Support. I also work for the </span><a href="http://mainraods.qld.gov.au/"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: verdana;">Queensland Department of Main Roads</span></a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: verdana;"> in Nerang, QLD. I live in Brisbane, and travel the 1 hour each way three days a week.</span></span></span></div><div><img alt="" border="0" src="{{ site.path }}/assets/2010-4-5-motivation-for-blogging/http://farm4.static.flickr.com/32253125936268_715b3ac5d3_m.jpg" style="display: block; height: 240px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-top: 0px; text-align: center; width: 159px;" /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: verdana;">My recent motivation for blogging came from reading, or rather listening to, </span><a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/what-would-google-do/"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: verdana;">"What Would Google Do?"</span></a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: verdana;">, from Jeff Jarvis (</span><a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: verdana;">BuzzMachine Blog</span></a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: verdana;">). The travelling I do make listening to audiobooks an ideal way for me to read. I heard about this book while listening to TWiG, a program on the </span><a href="http://twit.tv/"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: verdana;">TWiT</span></a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: verdana;"> network run by Leo Laporte. I found the book incredibly interesting and very thought provoking. I had to rewind the audiobook more than a few times because my mind would go off thinking about what what just said. I liked how Jarvis spoke about the internet being a conversation, and basically I decided I wanted to join.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: verdana;"><br/></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: verdana;">One rule I intend to follow when blogging is to keep my posts short. I must confess that when I read blogs, the one one of the most important factors in whether I read it or not is its length. On that note, this ends my first blog. PLEASE feel free to leave comments and suggestions.</span></div></p></div>
