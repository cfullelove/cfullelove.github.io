<div data-src="v5"><p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande'; font-size: small;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 11px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">I hate Lotus Notes. And, it seems, I am most definitely not the only one that thinks that way.</span></span></span><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande'; font-size: small;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 11px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><blockquote><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial; line-height: 24px;"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">This website is dedicated to my fellow sufferers who day in day out are forced to use Lotus Notes, causing them to struggle with email communications, squirm at the thought of planning another day and generally fighting for their will to live. Don't despair, don't be broken, don't hang yourself, stand up and be counted.</span></i></span></blockquote>The above quote was taken from the website <a href="http://www.ihatelotusnotes.com/">http://www.ihatelotusnotes.com</a>.</p><p><div style="text-align: justify;">I started a new job at a Queensland Government Department, Main Roads, 4-5 weeks ago. With all the nervousness and preparation, I never expected to meet the beast that is Lotus Notes.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Qeensland Main Roads (QMR) use the Notes for everything. Email, Business Directories, Calendars, etc. There are some functions I have yet to even figure out. Apparently there are numerous databases that the system is connected to and it requires "specially trained staff" to add to or change these databases.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">As I said before I've been working at QMR for about 5 weeks now and I still have not been added to these "databases" (which are apparently contain similar information but are not linked...) and therefore cannot access any details of my employment. This includes payslips, accrued hours information, bank details, nothing.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The interface itself looks as though it come from the 90's. Perhaps the reason my information hasn't been entered is because the only "trained personnel" are all dinosaurs and can't use a keyboard. I would love to give you a screenshot to illustrate this, but I don't (thankfully) have notes at home and the corporate network won't allow me onto Blogger.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Its funny also the recent battle <a href="http://buzzmachine.com/">Jeff Jarvis</a>&nbsp;and Howard Stern over Notes. You can follow @jeffjarvis on twitter to read more.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I am going to try and stay open minded. I mean, who knows? I could actually grow to like it! While I seriously doubt that eventuality, this will almost definitely not be the last you hear about Notes on this blog.</div></span></span></span></div></p></div>
