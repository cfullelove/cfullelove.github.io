<div data-src="v5"><p>I really really dislike statistics&#8230; as a Uni subject at least. But I did get the chance the produce something relatively cool in the process of doing an assignment recently.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="full-image-block ssNonEditable"><span><img style="width: 500px;" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50616230c4aaf3a25087208f/50616266e4b09bed8049ae97/50616267e4b09bed8049af5d/1288345544078/#img.gif1000w" alt="" /></span></span></p>
<p>So what is it? It&#8217;s a animation of a &#8220;robot&#8221; collecting &#8220;objects&#8221; within a circle. The purpose of the assignment question was to optimise the search pattern to collect the most amount of objects. My algorithm collects about 65% &#8230; which isn&#8217;t all that fantastic, but good enough for the required standard of the assignment.</p>
<p>The simulation is run using a script I wrote in PHP. The script produces a series of images that I turned into a animation using ImageMagick. If anyone is interested in the code, leave a note in the comment.</p></div>
