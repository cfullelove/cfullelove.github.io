<div data-src="v5"><p>In light of all the hype about the iPhone 4 antenna issue, I thought I would share my issues with reception on the iPhone 3G and how I have taken steps to remedy them.</p>
<p>I am on the <a href="http://www.three.com.au">3 mobile</a> network and I don&#8217;t think I would be the first to say that 3&#8217;s network coverage leaves a little be to desired. But it does have competitive prices and features, so I&#8217;m not going to slam them outright.</p>
<p>I have for always had trouble getting mobile reception at my house. It is in a bit of a valley and it double brick, so this is not surprising. When making or receiving calls at home I am plagued with dropped calls and poor call quality. For a long time the only way I had of dealing with this, was to take a walk outside.</p>
<p>Something I have discovered though is that if I change the settings in my iPhone 3G I can get <em>remarkably</em>&nbsp;better performance on calls, but there is a price which I will discuss after. The way I accomplish the improvement is by turning off 3G. This can be done in&nbsp;<em>Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Network.</em></p>
<p>The following images show the improvement in signal strength:</p>

<p>When you turn off 3G the phone looses reception completely for a few seconds before reconnecting again with significantly more bars showing. Now I appreciate that the number of bars isn&#8217;t always a good indicator of whether or not you will drop calls or not, but I can&nbsp;attest&nbsp;that using this method really does improve phone calls.</p>
<p>There a few things to take into consideration.&nbsp;Because this method means turning off 3G, any data use will be over EDGE or GPRS networks. Depending on your carrier, this could mean extra data costs. It also means that any data usage will be <em>really</em>&nbsp;slow. Of course the remedy for this is to only turn 3G off when you are making calls - just be careful to remember to turn it back on. If you are using this method at home like me, chances are that you have WiFi for data anyway - once again, remember to turn it back on when you leave home if you plan on using any data.</p>
<p>Using this method really has helped me better use my phone at home and at places with bad reception. Please try it out for yourself. I am keen to find out if others are able to share my results - especially with iPhone 3GS.</p>
