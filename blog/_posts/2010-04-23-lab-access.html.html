<div data-src="v5"><p style="text-align: justify;">As you are probably aware, I am in my&nbsp;pseudo-final year of my Bachelor of Engineering degree. In that final year students work on a year long project relating to their chosen field on study. I am currently working on mine. Unfortunately, however, my efforts to achieve any significant amount of progress has been restricted by, among other smaller issues, insufficient access to thesis labs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a student going a thesis project I was given access to a lab that has the facilities required to complete my project. The currently enforced access times for this Lab are 8am - 6pm, Monday to Friday. As you are probably aware, I work three days a week for <a href="http://www.tmr.qld.gov.au">Transport and Main Roads</a> in Nerang, thus limiting my lab time. I brought this issue up very early in the semester and I still have yet to get the access times extended to the weekends.</p>
<p>Below is a&nbsp;excerpt&nbsp;from an email I send to the lab supervisor this afternoon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Because the Bachelor of Engineering require 60 days of professional&nbsp;practice, I went searching for employment that would satisfy that&nbsp;need. I now work for Queensland Main Roads. This job is three days per&nbsp;week, 8 till 5. This works in well as my scheduled classes lie on the&nbsp;remaining 2 days. However, this does not leave me very much time at&nbsp;all for access to 47-401 to work on the practical aspects of my&nbsp;ENGG4801 Thesis project; perhaps 8 hours a week assuming I don&#8217;t take&nbsp;any breaks between thesis work and classes.<br /><br />As you could probably appreciate, this is not an ideal situation for&nbsp;me. Therefore, I am requesting that access to the Thesis Lab be&nbsp;extended such that I am able to make better use of its facilities. For&nbsp;example, extending the access to include weekends would be very&nbsp;beneficial for students in situations like mine. I don&#8217;t necessarily&nbsp;require 24/7 access, but reasonable access on the weekend would be&nbsp;greatly appreciated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having met the supervisor in person, he said he will use this case to hopefully appeal to the powers that be, and get the lab access extended.</p>
<p>I should point out two very annoying aspects of this situation:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>It is half-way through the semester and this situation has still to be taken care of.</li>
<li>There is a course of second and third year students that have 24 hour access to a lab in the same building!</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is not a lot I can do but wait and see the outcome the appeal - apparently set for Tuesday next week. I will give an update to this issue, hopefully one that involves success, when developments occur.</p></div>
