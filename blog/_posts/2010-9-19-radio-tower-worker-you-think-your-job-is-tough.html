<div data-src="v5"><p>I&#8217;ve already posted this on Twitter and Buzz, but I thought it deserved a post on my blog as well.</p>
<p>This is a video of a Radio Tower Technician climbing all the way to the top of a &#8220;guided radio tower&#8221;. It is scary enough given tower is taller than the Sears Tower - then you find out that they free climb! Be aware, this might make you feel&nbsp;queazy&#8230; Enjoy.</p>
