<div data-src="v5"><p style="text-align: justify;">Over the last week I have been listening to <a href="http://www.audible.com/adbl/site/products/ProductDetail.jsp?productID=BK_ADBL_000999&amp;BV_UseBVCookie=Yes">Parallel Worlds</a>, a book written by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michio_Kaku">Michio Kaku</a>. In this book, Michio Kaku explores the origin, development and future on the universe. It is similar in content, i suppose, to <a href="http://www.audible.com/adbl/site/products/ProductDetail.jsp?productID=BK_DOVE_000221&amp;BV_UseBVCookie=Yes">A Brief History of Time</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking">Stephen Hawking</a>, that I <a href="/blog/2010/4/9/audible.html">read</a> earlier this month, though perhaps a little more current. Yes, apparently I am overly interested in physics&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="full-image-block ssNonEditable"><span><img src="http://www.audible.com/audiblewords/content/bk/adbl/000999/t4_image.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1272010494614" alt="" /></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I very much enjoyed this book. Michio Kaku is very gifted in his ability to translate complex thoughts and ideas into a form that a mildly intelligent person can easily understand. My favourite example of this ability is how Kaku often relates the idea in a Science Fiction context. Perhaps this is because I hold more than just a small soft-spot for SciFi - but for me at least it made the content of this book far easier to understand.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for the topics covered in this book, they range from the historical perception of the universe, to the current understanding of how the universe looks and behaves.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">String theory is discussed quite extensively. Michio discusses the origins of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_Theory">String Theory</a>, the various versions that sprung into&nbsp;existence, and the emergence of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-Theory">M-Theory</a>, which served to largely unify these versions into a single form. This lead onto the discussion on the idea of the existence of higher dimensions and the various theories and ideas that revolve around them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Interesting philosophical questions raised by various theories and discoveries are discussed too. On more than a couple of&nbsp;occasions&nbsp;the existence and nature of <em>god</em>&nbsp;is covered, especially in relation to the beginning or creation of the universe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in physics, especially cosmology,&nbsp;particle&nbsp;physics with a hint of philosophy. Please let me know your thought on this book if you have read it. If you have read a book covering a similar topic, please share!</p>
