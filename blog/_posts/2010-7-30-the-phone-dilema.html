<div data-src="v5"><p>For about 300 days now I have been using an iPhone 3G. At the time I purchased the device I didn&#8217;t expect much from my phone - thought it only needed to make calls, send and receive messages, and maybe browse the web a bit. After using the iPhone 3G for a while I realised there was a whole lot more that it could do - the whole &#8220;there&#8217;s an app for that&#8221; thing. I liked this a lot and I confess that I was impressed and content for quite a while. Unfortunately times have changed - apparently 300 days is an eternity in the mobile space at the moment and the iPhone 3G is a relic. While it does still run apps, they run <em>painfully&nbsp;</em>slow and the lack of good actual call performance - you know, the whole purpose of having a phone? - is beginning to become a serious factor. So now I am considering a change. But the big question is, to what?</p>
<h3>My Requirements</h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 12px;">In light of my experience with the iPhone 3G, there a few key things I am looking for in a new phone (in no particular order):</span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Call Performance - That is good reception and no dropped calls</li>
<li>Fast user interface and applications</li>
<li>Touch interface - I really don&#8217;t think I could go back to a keypad&#8230;</li>
<li>Web browser</li>
<li>Good range of applications - Email, Twitter, Audible, Calendar, etc</li>
<li>Available for outright purchase - I don&#8217;t want to have to pay out my current contract (which has over a year till it expires)</li>
<li>Not overly expensive</li>
</ul>
<h3>My Options</h3>
<p>I have been toying with the idea of changing phone for a while now, and I have narrowed it down to these phones</p>
<p><strong>Nexus One</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="full-image-block ssNonEditable"><img src="http://www.feelandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/nexus_one.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1279871751762" alt="" /></span></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.google.com/phone/static/en_US-nexusone_tech_specs.html">HTC Google Nexus One</a>&nbsp;is the first phone that really got me thinking about moving to a phone. The Nexus One runs Google&#8217;s mobile operating system, <a href="http://www.android.com/">Android</a>. Google Android is a free and open source operating system that is really making its mark in the mobile phone market at the moment. It has many of the same features people have come to expect from the iPhone OS with its own twist.</p>
<p>What I like about the Nexus One is that it runs Android, has a really nice screen, all the apps I want/need and none of the restrictions that I have come to dislike on the iPhone platform. Also, it <em>smashes </em>the my current iPhone 3G&#8217;s technical capability, with 4x the RAM and more than twice the processor speed.</p>
<p>One detractor from the Nexus One though, is the fact that it isn&#8217;t available in Australia. Or at the very least not available <em>cheaply</em>&nbsp;in Australia. It is possible to get it shipped out from the US but the cost really doesn&#8217;t make it a good option unless you are dead set on this phone. Plus, Google recently stopped offering the Nexus One in the US as of a few days ago.</p>
<p><em>Apparently the Nexus One is available in Australia through <a href="http://store.vodafone.com.au/handset-htc-nexus-one.aspx">Vodafone&#8217;s Online Store</a>.</em></p>
<p><strong>HTC Desire</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="full-image-block ssNonEditable"><img src="http://images.intomobile.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/htc-desire-three.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1279872377766" alt="" /></span></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.htc.com/www/product/desire/overview.html">HTC Desire</a> is the pretty cousin of the Nexus One. The specs are very similar - same screen, processor, similar memory, etc. The Desire also runs Android, and therefore also shares those advantages that come with it.</p>
<p>The HTC Desire does come with few improvements though. It actually has more RAM (576mb as opposed to 512mb), an optical trackpad, slightly better video capture and the HTC Sense UI. The Sense UI is HTC&#8217;s wrapper on top of the vanilla Android experience seen in the Nexus One. Not having used either first hand I can&#8217;t really comment on one over the other, but I do know that the Sense UI can be disabled on the Desire, allowing both options.</p>
<p>The greatest advantage of the HTC Desire over the Nexus One for me is the matter of price and availability. The Desire is available a bit more easily and cheaply in Australia than the Nexus One.</p>
<p><strong>Apple iPhone 4</strong></p>
<p><span class="full-image-block ssNonEditable">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://storeimages.apple.com/4869/store.apple.com/Catalog/Australia/Images/iphone/img/product-hero-iphone4.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>I would be crazy not to consider the grandchild of my current phone, the iPhone 4. Featuring specs that now live up to the competition brought by the Android phones as well as an apparently spectacular display, the iPhone 4 really is a contender.</p>
<p>But I do have a few concerns with the iPhone 4. It is hard to ignore all the press lately about the reception issues caused by the external antenna. I don&#8217;t think that its a massive issue - I would almost definitely have it in a case anyway - but considering the fact my current phone really struggles with reception already it does make me a little nervous.</p>
<p>The other problem I see in the iPhone 4 is that of price. I am very worried that when it is available in Australia, that it will either not be available for purchase outright, or that the outright price will be too much. Currently the iPhone 3GS sells for $719 outright from the <a href="http://store.apple.com/au">Apple Store</a>, which is actually more than the two Android phones above. The iPhone 4 is almost definitely going to be more. The Apple Store currently reveals no price, but apparently its going be $850 ish.</p>
<h3>Where to now?</h3>
<p>Right now, I am still deciding whether or not I really should purchase a new phone all. I am&nbsp;conscious&nbsp;of that fact that any of the options I outlined above represent a fairly significant investment. Not to mention that if I do decide to invest, in the current climate the phone I choose could be rendered&nbsp;obsolete in a few months.&nbsp;But on the other hand, the usability and poor call performance of my iPhone 3G is slowly driving me crazy.</p>
<p>If I were somehow to find myself in possession of $700 that I could only spend on a new phone, my current choice would be the HTC Desire. In my opinion it wins in both overall price and value - plus I am really keen to try out the Android operating system.</p>
<p>I am keen to hear what others think about this dilema I find myself in. Do you think I should just get over my gripes about my iPhone 3G and stay put? Or do you think I should bite the bullet and go get the HTC desire? Please leave your comments below!</p>
