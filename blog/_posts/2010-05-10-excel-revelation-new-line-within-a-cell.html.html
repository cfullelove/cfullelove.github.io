<div data-src="v5"><p style="text-align: justify;">Have you ever had a large cell in MS Excel and wanted to write several lines within it? I have enountered numerous occassions where I wanted to do this and had to resort to many strange methods&#8230;but there is an easy solution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Until recently I knew of only two methods (i.e.&nbsp;<em>hacks</em>) to accomplish this. First, you could make several cells appear as one using borders&#8230; works, but limits you to the number of lines you originally put in and you have to change cell every line. The other method was to use line wrapping and push the <em>spacebar</em> until it would wrap around onto a new line - this method makes me cringe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Recently, I was informed there is a way to do it <strong>properly</strong>. While editing a cell&#8217;s contents, use the key combination <em>Alt-Enter</em>. This will create a new line within a cell. Amazing! So simple, and yet after <em>years</em> of using Excel (not simplistically either) I never knew it. I have no idea why it doesn&#8217;t conform to MS Word&#8217;s <em>Shift-Enter</em>&nbsp;combination for what appears to be a very similar function.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have a feeling this is not a well-known fact, so I hope my posting it will make using Excel that little bit easier to use. Feel free to post in the comments any other obscure, but useful, tips and tricks for commonly used applications.</p></div>
