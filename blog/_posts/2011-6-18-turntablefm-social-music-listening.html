<div data-src="v5"><p style="text-align: justify;">Just a quick note to introduce a fantastic new service that is spreading like crazy. Turntable.fm is a really cool site that allows you to join <em>Rooms</em> and listen to and DJ your favourite tracks - socially.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The site is only technically in beta at the moment, but you can get access if you have a Facebook friend already with access or by requesting an invite. Turned out I already had a friend with access, so I could jump straight in. (Thanks whoever that was..)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is how it works. First you join a room, say <a href="http://turntable.fm/coding_soundtrack3">this one</a>. Initially, you will join the &#8220;crowd&#8221; and listen to the tracks being offered up by a number of other users on the <em>Deck. </em>If a spot on the deck becomes available, you too can jump up and play your songs to the crowd. Each of the DJs takes a turn at playing a tack, looping around while DJs come and go.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="turntable.fm.png" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50616230c4aaf3a25087208f/50616266e4b09bed8049ae97/50616267e4b09bed8049afa4/1308403383127/#img.png.png" width="500" height="477" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can see an example room in the image above. To get a sense of whether a track being played it liked or not, there is a meter displaying the popularity as measured by votes from the crowd.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is a social gaming aspect to the site too. Every time you play a song as a DJ, you get a point. The more points you have, the more avatars you have access to. You can see above the DEADMAU5 avatar, which have access to at 1000 points.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The site also allows you to create your own rooms, if no current rooms suite your taste or if you want a semi-private experience. Only catch is that you need more than one person in a room before full tracks can be played due to license restrictions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are two ways to add tracks to your &#8220;DJ Queue&#8221;. Firstly, you can add from the Turntable.fm library. Second, you can upload your own track. When a track is playing, you are given the option to purchase the song in iTunes or add it to Last.fm or Spotify. I assume this is how they are making some money at the moment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anyway, I highly suggest you check this site out. I have been addicted to it lately, and I suspect many other will be too. If you have me as a friend on Facebook, you will automatically have access! (I will more than likely be hanging out in the Coding Soundtrack room)</p></div>
