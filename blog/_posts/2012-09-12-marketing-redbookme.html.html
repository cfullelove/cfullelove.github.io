<div data-src="v5"><p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.3451269215438515"> </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-align: justify;">Lately I&rsquo;ve been struggling with a bit of an obsession. I&#8217;ve mentioned previously (</span><a style="text-align: justify;" href="/blog/2011/10/9/backend-selection-issues.html">here</a><span style="text-align: justify;">) that I built an availability and roster system for the pizza shop I used to work for. Well, the project has slowly been digging its claws into me and I&rsquo;ve been spending quite a deal of time on it. I&rsquo;ve made a heap of improvements to the underlying architecture (it&rsquo;s really stable and fast!), but also I&rsquo;m starting to think a bit more commercially. Basically, I think the product is finally at the stage where I believe other businesses could use it - that is, in addition to the shop I used to work at ;-).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" dir="ltr">The application has always been referred to as &ldquo;Redbook&rdquo; because before it existed, we did actually use a red book to record when staff were and weren&rsquo;t available. I&rsquo;d been fighting against keeping the name for a while because I was afraid other&rsquo;s wouldn&rsquo;t get it. Recently, however, I changed my mind and decided to go with it. Hence, I submit to you <a href="http://redbook.me/">redbook.me</a> - the product page for my web app. (It&rsquo;s got a cool Web2.0 sounding name and everything! :-P)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" dir="ltr">The <a href="http://redbook.me/">redbook.me</a> page is intended to be super simple and describe the product - what it does, how much it costs, etc. My sincere hope is that it will get some interest and I&rsquo;ll be able to share redbook.me with other people.</p>
<p>I believe that redbook.me is really useful and that business owners and their staff, espically in the hospitality industry, will greatly benifit from using it. If you&rsquo;re so inclined, I would appreciate any comments you have on the product or the page.</p>
