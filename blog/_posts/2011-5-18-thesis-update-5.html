<div data-src="v5"><p>Quick update on the progress I&#8217;m making on my Thesis.</p>
<p>While waiting for PCBs to be manufactured, I have been working on the software components of the project.</p>
<p>The Hub application is progressing relatively well. I have managed to get the sensor network communications working to a point. The storage and server component hasn&#8217;t really had much attention as its composition will depend on how the Android app is built.</p>
<p>I have made a decent amount of progress on the Android App. While I haven&#8217;t got it talking to anything yet, I have learnt heaps about how the UI works which is a big part of it. Here are some screenshots:</p>
