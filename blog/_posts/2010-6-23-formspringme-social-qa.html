<div data-src="v5"><p style="text-align: justify;">On recent episode of <a href="http://twit.tv/natn">net@night</a>&nbsp;(hosted by Leo Laporte &amp; Amber MacArthur), an interesting new website <a href="http://formspring.me">Formspring.me</a> was discussed. Formspring is a really cool service. Basically, you have a profile where people can ask you questions, and you can answer them. Simple as that.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It may sound a bit dull or pointless, but through reading other&#8217;s answers to questions on their <a href="http://formspring.me/cfullelove">profile</a>, you can really learn alot about a person. Not only that, if you are someone that never knows what to talk about, you can create content purely from reacting to questions people ask.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can create an account on the <a href="http://formspring.me">Formspring site</a>, or log in using Facebook Connect. From there, search for people you know already using the service, invite others to join, and start asking and answering questions.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">If you would like to ask me any question, you can use the widget below (provided by Formspring to allow website owners to capture questions from their sites)</p>
