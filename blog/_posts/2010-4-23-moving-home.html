<div data-src="v5"><p><p style="text-align: justify;">You may have noticed a few changes to the layout of the blog over the last 24 hours. I&#8217;ve moved hosting to <a href="http://www.squarespace.com">Squarespace</a>. This service provides a much more feature rich experience for me, as well as hopefully better reading experience for readers.<br /><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/universal/images/squarespace/squarespace-powered-200.png?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1271982530637" alt="" /><br /><p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;m using the Pro package on Squarespace. This means I can assign my own domainname as well as a few extra features probably not evident to the public. It isn&#8217;t a free service&#8230; it costs ~$12 a month. I do believe this is a justifiable expense though. I rationalise this by thinking of other purchases I have made and the cost forms a small percentage of my overall expenses. I also am hoping that <em>one day</em> I will be able to actually <strong>generate</strong> money from this site&#8230;<br /><p style="text-align: justify;">The RSS feed for this blog has already been transferred. You may notice read items become unread again though. The feed items will point to the new site.<br /><p style="text-align: justify;">The www.fullelove.com and blog.fullelove.com domainnames are currently in the process of transferring to Squarespace. This means tha the blogger site will no longer be active, and <em>should</em> redirect to the new site.<br /><p style="text-align: justify;">Feel free to share your opinions in the comments regarding the move.<br /><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/universal/images/squarespace/squarespace-black-button.png?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1271982618337" alt="" /></p></div>
