<div data-src="v5"><p>One of the things I really enjoy is discovering and trying out new websites and services on the internet. So I thought I&rsquo;d post a few of my favourites / recent discoveries.</p>
<h3><a href="http://console.fm"><strong>Console.fm</strong></a></h3>
<p>This website allows you to stream a playlist of music from different electronic genres. It&#8217;s very simple, and I&#8217;m not actually sure how they make money, but if you&#8217;re stuck without your own music its great.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.codecademy.com"><strong>Codecademy</strong></a></h3>
<p>This is one of the recent sites from Y Cominator that seems to be a platform for teaching people how to code. It seems pretty scant on the courses at the moment, but it has a very clean interface and the tutorials are quite nice. One to watch I suppose!</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.stypi.com/"><strong>Stypi</strong></a></h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s another Y Combinator child - Stypi is a really sleek online collaborative editor with chat. It has a few features from Google&#8217;s Wave platform, like a &#8220;Playback&#8221; feature an simulatenous editing. It seems to be aimed a little towards the programmer user given it allows for code highlighting etc - but I think that people just needing plain text collaboration would find this massively useful also!</p>
<h3><a href="www.jig.com"><strong>Jig</strong></a></h3>
<p>Jig has just launched services from <a href="http://www.tastylabs.com/">Tasy Labs</a> and seems to be a &#8220;need marketplace&#8221;. It lets people post &#8220;needs&#8221; as well as suggest solutions for other peoples &#8220;needs&#8221;. Its an interesting spin on traditional &#8220;post everything&#8221; networks such as Twitter, Facebook and Google+. My profile is <a href="https://www.jig.com/profile/chris-fullelove">here</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="http://zerply.com">Zerply</a></h3>
<p>A very pretty &#8220;about me&#8221; type site. Allows you to have a profile page about yourself - can fetch from LinkedIn etc. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://zerp.ly/cfullelove">mine</a></p>
<h3><a href="http://www.workflowy.com"><strong>Workflowy</strong></a></h3>
<p>Workflowy is probably my favourite - and most heavily used - website at the moment. It&#8217;s motto, &#8220;Organise Your Brain&#8221;, is exactly what it does. It basically a sleek interface to bullet point lists. The lists are nestable, which means you can have lists of lists of lists etc. Additionally, to cut down on information overload, you are able to <em>zoom in</em> so that only a sublist is shown. You can also share lists and make them editable by others if you wish.</p>
<p>I use workflowy for a heap of things - A todo list, knowledge base, organiser, collaboration, brain storming, etc. I seriously encourage you to check it out ;-)</p>

<p>I hope you get the chance to check some of these sites out, and perhaps even use them for a bit. I think I&#8217;m going to do posts like this on a more regular basis so let me know what you think. Also, if you have any really cool sites that you think I should check out, let me know!</p></div>
