<div data-src="v5"><p>Last week I was involved in some routine&nbsp;maintenance&nbsp;down at the <a href="http://www.mainroads.qld.gov.au/Projects/A-Z-Search/N-T/Tugun-Bypass-project.aspx">Tugun Tunnel</a> on the Tugun Bypass. While I have driven through the tunnel several times, this was my first experience from a engineering perspective. The maintenance was quite extensive, involving a closure of the Tugun Bypass over two nights. I learnt a lot about the systems involved in making it all work, very interesting stuff.</p>

<p>The tunnel itself is very interesting. I was told it is the only tunnel in Australia that allows traffic travelling at 100 km/h. It also apparently allows vehicles carrying flammable materials through, though does limit other dangerous materials. The tunnel is about 340m long and partly runs&nbsp;underneath&nbsp;the Gold Coast Airport; a fact I was perviously unaware of.</p>
<p>My purpose in being there for the work was mainly to familiarise myself with the systems both conceptually and physically. I am still relatively new at QLD Main Roads, so the opportunity presented by the maintenance work was taken to train me up. My team is looks after the Intelligent Systems and Electrical aspects of the tunnel. These systems are broken up into three major sections, Plant Management, Fire, Intelligent Traffic Systems.</p>

<p>The Intelligent Traffic Systems deal with all the traffic signage and monitoring devices in the tunnel, as well as elsewhere on the bypass. This includes the variable speed signs (VSS), variable message signs (VMS) and CCTV cameras. The traffic systems were designed by Tyco, and they also provide the software that control and monitor the system. Because of the interesting geographical and political situation at the Tugun, the ITS system does not connect directly into the rest of the QLD ITS infrastructure.</p>
<p>Overall, I found the experience very informative and useful. It has given me a different perspective of how the Tunnel works, and all the complex systems that make it function. Hopefully, this post will make others see the Tunnel in a slightly different light the next time they go through it too.</p></div>
