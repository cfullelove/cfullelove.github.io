<div data-src="v5"><p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;ve been using the <a href="http://www.apple.com/au/ipad">iPad</a> for a couple of weeks now, and for the most part the experience has been great. The hardware is fantastic and the Apps are pretty good. I have, however, uncovered a few annoyances that I think others may benefit from hearing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>WiFi Only</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have a WiFi only model iPad. Now for my financial position, this was and still is the correct choice if buying an iPad. Being WiFi only isn&#8217;t a disadvantage if you have WiFi available all the time&#8230; and up until recently I hadn&#8217;t tested the iPad&#8217;s functionality without being connected.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Offline Reading</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My first dilema was reading PDFs somewhere that didn&#8217;t have WiFi. I thought this would be a simple process&#8230; I was wrong. If you have an internet connection reading PDFs only requires clicking on a link in Safari - obviously this isn&#8217;t an option if you don&#8217;t have WiFi. Further, because Apple doesn&#8217;t allow Apps access to the filesystem it is not a trivial operation to transfer a PDF (or any other non-music/video document) onto your iPad ahead of time. I found two methods to accomplish this.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One approach requires&nbsp;acquiring&nbsp;a third-party app and adding the PDFs I wanted to read through iTunes&#8217; <em>File Sharing</em>&nbsp;function in the Apps tab when the iPad is connected. You can see a screenshot of this process below.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="{{ site.path }}/assets/2010-5-9-ipad-annoyances/1273378665407.jpg">Dropbox</a> to sync and backup my personal and university documents, and they have a recently released iPad app. You can view your files while connected to WiFi and &#8220;Star&#8221; (add to favourites)&nbsp;a file you want to keep a copy of on your iPad for offline viewing. Sadly, I wasn&#8217;t aware of this approach until after I wanted to read offline&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="thumbnail-image-block ssNonEditable"><span><a href="javascript:Y.Squarespace.Utils.lightboxAsset('50616267e4b09bed8049aece');"></a></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="full-image-block ssNonEditable"><span><img src="{{ site.path }}/assets/2010-5-9-ipad-annoyances/1273378900547.jpg">Plants vs Zombies</a>, <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/harbor-master-hd/id363658120?mt=8">Harbour Master</a> and Solitaire don&#8217;t require an internet connection. Some of the more interesting and socially minded games, however, do. These include <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/godfinger-for-ipad/id361431917?mt=8">GodFinger</a> and <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/au/app/we-rule-for-ipad/id361536763?mt=8">We Rule</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For someone like me this limitation is pretty easy to get over - I&#8217;m not a big gamer. But someone who loves mobile gaming, especially those with a social bent, may find this a bit more than just a simple annoyance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3G</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Obviously, if you had an 3G iPad all the annoyances above would likely disappear. But it really comes down to what you are willing to pay. Is an additional $200 on the initial investment plus $30+ a month for data really worth paying for that convenience? For some people and applications the answer to this question may indeed be yes. For me - not even close.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For anyone thinking of purchasing an iPad, chances are they have an iPhone too. So if you really need to tend to your followers on Godfinger (As well as the ability to browse the web and do actually&nbsp;<em>useful</em>&nbsp;things), you have your iPhone for that. And if you for some reason leave home with only your iPad and you<em>&nbsp;must</em>&nbsp;have an internet connection&#8230; there is always <a href="http://wirelesslans.com.au/wifi/mcdonalds-australia-store-wifi-locator.html">McDonalds</a>.</p></div>
