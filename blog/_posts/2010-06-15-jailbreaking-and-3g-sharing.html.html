<div data-src="v5"><p style="text-align: justify;">After holding out for what I would consider a decent amount of time, I finally caved and jailbroke my iPhone 3G. My justification is that, with the upcoming release of the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone">iPhone 4</a>, my 3G really is running out of steam in terms of new and exciting new features it can actually handle. My other motivation is that I really wanted to find a way to share my 3G internet connection on my iPhone over Wifi - specifically, I wanted to share it with my iPad.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sharing my existing 3G connection has a number of pretty obvious advantages. Firstly, I don&#8217;t have to pay for another data plan. Secondly, I don&#8217;t have to shell out for an iPad that has a 3G modem in it. And lastly, because I&#8217;m sharing over Wifi, I can share it to any other devices that support Wifi connectivity too.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Following, is my brief account of how I managed to share my 3G connection.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Jailbreak</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This part was crazy easy. It literally took me 5 minutes - including the time required to google the method. To save you the trouble of googling, the website that contains the most up to date jailbreaking software is:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><a href="http://spiritjb.com/">http://spiritjb.com/</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I downloaded, installed and ran this software, and after a short wait, my iPhone was out of the &#8220;Apple Jail&#8221;. It&#8217;s that simple.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sharing 3G</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before I actually considered jailbreaking my phone, I did confirm that there were indeed unapproved apps available that would perform the function I wanted. It turns out there are a couple (not surprisingly).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Currently the best contender seems to be the <em><a href="http://rockyourphone.com/index.php/mywi.html">MyWi</a></em>&nbsp;app. The app appears to come from the <a href="http://rockyourphone.com">&#8220;Rock Your Phone&#8221;</a> website/store. I don&#8217;t pretent to understand the&nbsp;subtleties&nbsp;of the jailbroken app ecosystem though.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I installed the <em>MyWi </em>app using the Cydia app that gets installed as part of the jailbreak. It requires signing up for account on the &#8220;Rock Your Phone&#8221; website and includes a 10 day free trial. Which leads me to the only negative of the situation - its not free. It only costs US$9.99 though, and in my opinion that cost is <em>far </em>lower than what you would have to pay for legitimate methods.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Problems</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The experience wasn&#8217;t entirely awesome. As you would expect, having both the 3G modem and the Wifi radio running concurrently chews up battery like there is no tomorrow. This kinda sucks as the iPhone&#8217;s battery life really isn&#8217;t all the great to begin with.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Secondly, I have had a couple of instances where I wasn&#8217;t sure whether I had&nbsp;successfully&nbsp;turned off the Wifi sharing. It may be a bug, or my iPad isn&#8217;t rescanning quickly enough, but it did make me a little nervous - mainly for the power consumption aspect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lastly, I&#8217;m not 100% sold on the security options. MyWi allows WEP security, but that really doesn&#8217;t stand up to much these days. Also there doesn&#8217;t appear to be any ways to filter or block access to devices.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Given the fact that this is a illegitimate solution to a otherwise costly problem, this is a really is very good option. And it is worth keeping in mind that the software is still relatively new. Hopefully in the future it will improve - perhaps adding WPA security? I haven&#8217;t really had a chance to test it thoroughly, but from what I have used so far it works really well. Feel free to ask questions about any part of the above process.</p></div>
