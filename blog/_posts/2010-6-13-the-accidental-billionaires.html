<div data-src="v5"><p style="text-align: justify;">I recently finished reading <em><a href="http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-3937879-10273919?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.audible.com%2Fadbl%2Fstore%2Fwelcome.jsp%3Fsource_code%3DCOMA0216WS042109%26entryRedirect%3D%2Fentry%2Foffers%2FproductPromo2.jsp%26entryParams%3D%5EproductID%7EBK_RAND_001858&amp;cjsku=BK_RAND_001858" target="_top"> The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding of Facebook</a><img src="http://www.awltovhc.com/image-3937879-10273919" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /></em>&nbsp;by <a href="http://www.benmezrich.com/">Ben Mezrich</a>. As the title suggests, the book is about the creation of the rather well known website <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>. Having used Facebook for some time, I thought I knew a decent amount of Facebook&#8217;s history. It turns out, however, I didn&#8217;t have the slightest clue how crazy it was! Here&#8217;s the publisher&#8217;s summary.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><strong>Publisher&#8217;s Summary</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><em>The high-energy tale of how two socially awkward Ivy Leaguers, trying to increase their chances with the opposite sex, ended up creating Facebook.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;">Eduardo Saverin and Mark Zuckerberg were Harvard undergraduates and best friends, outsiders at a school filled with polished prep-school grads and long-time legacies. They shared both academic brilliance in math and a geeky awkwardness with women.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;">Eduardo figured their ticket to social acceptance, and sexual success, was getting invited to join one of the university&#8217;s Final Clubs, a constellation of elite societies that had groomed generations of the most powerful men in the world and ranked on top of the inflexible hierarchy at Harvard.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;">Mark, with less of an interest in what the campus alpha males thought of him, happened to be a computer genius of the first order. And he used his genius to find a more direct route to social stardom: one lonely night, Mark hacked into the university&#8217;s computer system, creating a ratable database of all the female students on campus and subsequently crashing the university&#8217;s servers and nearly getting himself kicked out of school. In that moment, in his Harvard dorm room, the framework for Facebook was born.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;">What followed - a real-life adventure filled with slick venture capitalists, stunning women, and six-foot-five-inch identical-twin Olympic rowers - makes for one of the most entertaining and compelling books of the year.&nbsp;<em>The Accidental Billionaires</em>&nbsp;is a compulsively readable story of innocence lost, and of the unusual creation of a company that has revolutionized the way hundreds of millions of people relate to one another.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;">&copy;2009 Ben Mezrich; (P)2009 Random House</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I really enjoyed the book. It is told as a narrative, which at first I thought was a little weird, but it really makes for an entertaining read. It is very interesting reading about how &#8220;cut-throat&#8221; the whole situation was (and possible still is).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This book should be read by anyone interested in the history of Facebook or the internet in general - very entertaining. The link to the Audible page is below.</p>
