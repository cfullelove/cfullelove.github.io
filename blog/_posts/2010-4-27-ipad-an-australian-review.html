<div data-src="v5"><p><span class="full-image-block ssNonEditable">&nbsp;</span>Yes, I have an <a href="http://www.apple.com/iPad">iPad</a>. I was lucky enough to get one early despite the fact that they aren&#8217;t going to be released in Australia until <a href="http://www.apple.com/au/ipad">&#8220;Late May&#8221;</a>. As I mentioned in an <a href="/blog/2010/4/18/ipad-owner-almost.html">earlier post</a>, my parents were in the US and managed to pick one up for me. Read on for my thoughts.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.tuaw.com/media/2010/04/apple-ipad-tablet-x-ray-1272278006.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1272348490045" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The image above is an X-Ray of an iPad from <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=1&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http://miyasei.exblog.jp/13188937/&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en">this blog</a>.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Straight away, I&#8217;m going to say I very much like the iPad. I received it when my family arrived home on Monday morning and have played with it on and off since then.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Physically, I was immediately surprised by its thinness. I have seen scores of images all over the internet, but to actually feel how thin the iPad is was definitely different. The overall feel of the device is quite nice too. You can carry it with one hand easily, but holding it horizontally with one hand while using the other hand to touch may take a bit of muscle building.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The touch interface is really nice. Having a display of that size respond to touch is really something else. Also, the sound is fantastic. The speaker in the iPad can produce some serious volume with very nice quality.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Applications. This was a little interesting. First off, I setup and synced my iPad with iTunes. I already own an iPhone, and it gave me the option to copy those applications across. Getting new applications was a problem though. The Australian AppStore doesn&#8217;t yet support iPads, so I couldn&#8217;t use my existing account to get any iPad Apps.&nbsp;To get new iPad apps, my parents also bought an iTunes Gift card from the US. Activating this with a spare email address and fake phone number and address let me sign in and buy/download iPad applications from the US Store. Sadly, the Gift Card was only $15&#8230; An incredible amount of restraint was necessary not to use that up all at once.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Running iPhone apps on the iPad was a much more <em>ugly</em>&nbsp;experience than I expected. Pixel doubling, while a good idea from a&nbsp;compatibility&nbsp;standpoint, really doesn&#8217;t score any points for beauty&#8230;</p>

I&#8217;ve put a few screenshots below:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="thumbnail-image-inline ssNonEditable"><span>&nbsp;<a href="javascript:Y.Squarespace.Utils.lightboxAsset('50616267e4b09bed8049aec0');"><img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50616230c4aaf3a25087208f/50616266e4b09bed8049ae97/50616267e4b09bed8049aebc/1272352877227/#img.jpg.Utils.lightboxAsset('50616267e4b09bed8049aec1');"><img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50616230c4aaf3a25087208f/50616266e4b09bed8049ae97/50616267e4b09bed8049aebd/1272352938573/#img.jpg.com/">TweetDeck</a>. Being more of a desktop/widget style platform, the iPad application works really well. It has a very dark theme (which might be able to be changed?) but still looks and functions quite well. As you might have guessed, this is what I am currently using for Twitter on my iPad.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="thumbnail-image-inline ssNonEditable"><span><span class="thumbnail-image-inline ssNonEditable"><span>For now at least I think the greatest thing about the iPad is its web browsing. The fact that you can take the iPad anywhere (with WiFi) and use the internet on a screen that doesn&#8217;t give you a headache is very valuable. I think that web applications have a huge future on the iPad, especially when you see support for technologies such as HTML 5 on the increase. I have used a few webapps on the iPad so far. <a href="http://www.gmail.com">GMail</a> has a iPad version that looks not dissimilar to the included Mail application. The <a href="http://www.google.com/reader">Google Reader</a> mobile site feels like it was built for the iPad from the beginning. The interface just works very well, and is a pleasure to read blogs and comics with.I do think that once the iPad becomes a little more mature, the 3rd party apps will follow. I believe we will see some incredible new and&nbsp;innovative&nbsp;apps pop up in the next couple of months. These apps too, I think, will maybe quiet some of the questions regarding the iPads place in the market.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="thumbnail-image-inline ssNonEditable"><span><span class="thumbnail-image-inline ssNonEditable"><span>This is an exceedingly long post, so I will leave it here for now. But PLEASE ask questions about aspects of the ipad that you are curious. I am more than happy to answer them.</span></span></span></span></p>
