<p><a href="http://bit.ly/fullelove_thesis_abstract">Abstract</a> - <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=explorer&amp;chrome=true&amp;srcid=0B1vJRa0OFprHMzFjMTM2MzUtMDE0OS00OWMwLWE3MDAtNjgwZmNlY2IwN2Rm&amp;hl=en&amp;authkey=CNLxtqwD">Poster</a></p>
<p>In other news I have created a ominous little countdown timer for the different due dates I have relating to my Thesis Project - <a href="/christopher/countdown">http://fullelove.me/christopher/countdown</a></p>
<p>I am mainly focusing on the software side of things at the moment while I am waiting for my PCBs to be made. I am working to build a multithreaded Java app to act as the communications and storage hub for the system. So far I have built the ability to talk to the XBee devices (using serial) and have got Threads basically working.</p>
<p>I am going to be doing some of the Hub application testing by building a &#8220;dummy&#8221; serial device to generate telemetry from as if coming from one of the power monitoring circuits.</p>
<p>Next job is to really get moving on the Android app.</p></div>
