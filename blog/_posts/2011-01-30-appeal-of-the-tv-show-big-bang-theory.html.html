<div data-src="v5"><p style="text-align: justify;">Lately I have been watching the TV show Big Bang Theory. I really quite enjoy the show&#8230; despite the fact it is very mainstream and not particularly thought provoking.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The reason I think I enjoy Big Bang Theory so much can be described by looking at the graph below:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><span class="full-image-block ssNonEditable"><span><img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50616230c4aaf3a25087208f/50616266e4b09bed8049ae97/50616267e4b09bed8049af78/1296393461813/#img.jpg1000w" alt="" /></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a quick (and not to scale) graph showing the perceived comedic value in the Big Bang Theory show versus how &#8220;nerdy&#8221; the viewer is (otherwise known as the &#8220;Nerd Coefficient&#8221;, NC ).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My thoughts behind the graph are this.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The &#8220;Wolowitz Constant&#8221; refers to the fact that almost everyone will find the Wolowitz character&#8217;s seedy comments very funny regardless of their NC. This constant may also be attributed to the feminine appeal of the Penny character for a male audience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just before the &#8220;Point of Insult&#8221; is where the more nerdy viewers will get almost all of the jokes and references but still find it hilarious. Just after is where the even more nerdy viewers will actually be insulted by the jokes. So, the &#8220;Point of Insult&#8221; is the point at which the content all of a sudden becomes insulting (and therefore not funny) due to too many points of similarity between the characters and the viewer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Further along the NC axis, we find a growing indifference to the &#8220;Point of Insult&#8221; factor. However at this point - as one would be truly nerdy now - the viewer may begin to be annoyed by the paradoxical nature of Sheldon&#8217;s character, hence the marked &#8220;Sheldon Paradox&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Personally, I think I find myself somewhere just before the &#8220;Point of Insult&#8221;, which in my opinion explains why I find the show so funny. Where are you on this graph? Do you agree with my depiction of the relationship?</p></div>
