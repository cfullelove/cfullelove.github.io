<div data-src="v5"><p>For a little while now, I&#8217;ve been running a very small business that provides a web-based roster management system for two pizza stores. I developed the application myself while actually employed at these stores, and after leaving, allowed the owner to continue using it for a monthly fee.</p>
<p>The plan was to use these two stores as a testbed to improve application and eventually get it to a point where I could market it to other small businesses. However, due to a lack of time and energy on my part, this plan hasn&#8217;t quite come to fuition.</p>
<p>My hopeful solution to this problem is, simply, to get some help. I haven&#8217;t kept this project going in the hopes that I might get rich from it - rather I was hoping to use it as a learning experience both technically (the application itself) and commercially (how to run a small business). Taking this into account, I can see no harm - in fact I see a necessity - in getting someone else on board to give me a hand.</p>
<p>So what am I actually looking for? I am looking for someone similar to myself - i.e someone looking to <em>learn by doing</em> about running a small business as well as building a software application. Surely, somewhere there is is a person out there looking for a small project to work on - I know I would be (and perhaps have in moments of weakness). I can&#8217;t promise any immediate financial compensation, but depending on how things go I am more than willing to talk formal partnerships and profit sharing.</p>
<p>Some background on the product:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Built in PHP - and not some of my best work if I&#8217;m honest</li>
<li>Uses some jQuery on the frontend, but nothing major.</li>
<li>Using MySQL for a database</li>
<li>Code comments could be improvement</li>
<li>Currently running on Jumba Web hosting</li>
<li>It works - but isn&#8217;t particularly pretty</li>
<li>Handles rosters and availabilities for two stores currently - each staff member is able to login and enter the days they can work.</li>
<li>I have started an overhaul project to clean up the code and make it more functional - this is running on a VPS</li>
</ul>
<p>I am very keen to talk to anyone that is interested, but I really am looking for someone who could see themselves committing to this project at least as much as myself. Feel free to ask as many question as required.</p>
<p>On a side note, I will be putting this post (or at least a link) onto a few services to getting a better change of engagement. If you know of anyone who could be interested, please let them (or me) know!</p>
