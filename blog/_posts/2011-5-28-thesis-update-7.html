<div data-src="v5"><p>Its been a while since an update. This is largely because I have been swamped trying to get my project ready for demonstration. Thankfully, I managed to get everything working well enough to demonstrate to my examiner and supervisor on Thursday. To say that things worked was a relief is an understatement, but it turns out that the demonstration endured far less scrutiny in terms of my design and implementation than I expected. I'm not quite sure why this is... but hopefully it isn't a bad sign.</p>
<p>I want to get some sort of video demo up for everyone to see my project in action at some point, but thats most likely going to happen after my actual thesis writeup has been done.</p>
<p>I thought it would be interesting to get some sort of tracking of the number of words my thesis contains versus time. I can't explain exactly why... other than I think its cool. So below I have included a Google Docs Chart that contains a graph of the number of words in my thesis document over time! Hopefully you should see this line skyrocket in the next few days....</p>
