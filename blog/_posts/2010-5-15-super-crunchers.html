<p style="text-align: justify;"><span >I recently finished reading yet another audiobook I purchased from&nbsp;</span><a  href="http://www.audible.com"><span >Audible.com</span></a><span >. The book is called&nbsp;</span><em ><span >Super Crunchers</span></em><span >&nbsp;by Ian Ayres. This book is all about the subject I have had a love-hate relationship through my academic career;&nbsp;</span><strong><span >statistics</span></strong><span >. I love statistics in that I appreciate that its hugely powerful and can tell you all sorts of things - I hate statistics because in any subject I have studied it I do very poorly&#8230;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span >&nbsp;<img src="http://www.audible.com/audiblewords/content/bk/bkot/000991/t4_image.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1273898794760" alt="" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em ><span >Super Crunchers</span></em><span >&nbsp;is incredibly interesting considering it&#8217;s subject matter. It basically talks about all the different methods &#8220;super crunchers&#8221; - people that apply statistical processes on huge datasets - use and the&nbsp;myriad&nbsp;of results they produce and their accompanying implications. It also shows how &#8220;thinking by numbers&#8221; can provide you with the tools to greatly improve your estimating ability or predicting powers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span >There are three main methods discussed in detail. Firstly, there is the classical method of regression.&nbsp;</span><em ><span >Super Crunchers</span></em><span >&nbsp;shows how&nbsp;statisticians&nbsp;can derive relationships between different variables by crunching past data. One included example is how regression could used to predict the sale value of a season&#8217;s wine by looking at the average rainfall and temperature during that season.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span >The second method explored was the use of random experiments. The idea is that you take a group of people and with coin flip subject them to one of two experiences where only one aspect is different. In doing so, one can be confident that any difference in result can be solely attributed to that aspect - all other variables are controlled. An example is how a website can randomly show one of two different layouts and compare sales. Google uses this approach all the time - A-B testing to discover the best layout or feature.</span></p>
<p style="font-size: 100%; text-align: justify;"><span >The third method that was explored, though in slightly less detail, was the power of neural networks. These networks can be &#8220;trained&#8221; with previous data and then used to predict future outcomes, supposedly&nbsp;mimicking&nbsp;the way the human brain processes information. Apparently&nbsp;neural&nbsp;networks are used extensively to increase gambling success.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span >Ian Ayres comes from both a super crunching and law background, and therefore discusses a number of interesting cases of how super crunching is&nbsp;incorporated&nbsp;into law and political policies. The most interest example was whether of not the concealed gun laws reduced or increased the crime rate.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span >One theme that runs throughout the book is that conflict between predictions that rely on statistical models and those made based on personal experience and intuition.&nbsp;</span><em ><span >Super Crunchers</span></em><span >&nbsp;also explorers how you can use both in concert to improve your ability to predict outcomes or estimations.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span >I highly recommend&nbsp;</span><em ><span >Super Crunchers</span></em><span >&nbsp;to anyone interested in how thinking by numbers can be used to predict future events and estimate the impact of decisions they make. Even if, like me, you were never good at statistics you may still find this book very interesting.</span></p>
