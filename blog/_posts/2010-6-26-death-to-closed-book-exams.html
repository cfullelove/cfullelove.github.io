<div data-src="v5"><p>On Friday, I sat the last exam of the Uni semester. While I admit I hadn&#8217;t studied quite as much as I perhaps should have, I went into the 3hr exam with expectations do alright. Walking out of it, however, my expectations had proved to be seriously off the mark.</p>
<p>A little background on the course</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to go right out and say that this course is most likely the poorest administered of any I have studied while at UQ. The course title was &#8220;COMS3100: Introduction to Communications&#8221; and as you would expect, it covered everything from analogue and digital signals, RF and Fibre Optic mediums to Information Theory.</p>
<p>Here is a breakdown of the assessment:</p>
<ul>
<li>4x Assignments (5% each)</li>
<li>1x Midsemester Exam (10%)</li>
<li>1x Practical Exam (10%)</li>
<li>1x Final Exam (60%)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;My issues with this course extend to ALL of these assessment items.</p>
<p>The assignments, as far as the content they covered were fine - not hugely difficult. The problems arose after they were actually handed in. I handed in the 2nd assignment on the 14th of April. We received the marks on the 14th of June. It was worth 5%! How does it take 2 months to mark that?? As for assignments 3 and 4, well, I don&#8217;t expect to ever find those marks out.</p>
<p>The midsemester exam was, from a students point of view, a gift. Not only was the exam almost a carbon copy of the previous two years&#8217; exams, the SAME TYPOS WERE INCLUDED! So in truth, I don&#8217;t have much to complain about this assessment item, but it definitely goes to my point of the course being poorly run.</p>
<p>The practical exam was probably the best run part of the course. The exam wasn&#8217;t especially troublesome, and the marks came out in a relatively timely manner.</p>
<p>The Final Exam is where I had the biggest problem. For starters, the exam was worth 60% of the course, lasted for 3 hours, and it was closed book.</p>
<p>From the course profile:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Weight:&nbsp;</strong>60%<br /><strong>Perusal:&nbsp;</strong>10 minutes<br /><strong>Duration:&nbsp;</strong>180 minutes<br /><strong>Format:&nbsp;</strong>Multiple-choice, Short answer, Short essay, Problem solving&nbsp;<br /><strong>Task Description:&nbsp;</strong>The final examination will be held during the final examination period. It is 3 hours and closed book. You may bring a battery-operated non-programmable calculator. Programmable calculators and other computing or communication devices are&nbsp;<em>not</em>permitted.</p>
<p>You will notice that it mentions in the &#8220;Format&#8221; section, that the exam would include multiple choice questions. It did not. The entire exam was short or long answer questions.</p>
<p>Something I didn&#8217;t mention was that the total number of lectures slides for the semester was about 600. So, this exam required you to understand 600 slides of information, plus tutorial solutions (which didn&#8217;t publish worked examples) and remember it all.</p>
<p>You might think that for all that, at least the exam would have been loosely based based on the previous exams, right? If you seriously stretched the definition of the work &#8220;loosely&#8221; then, maybe. Some fellow students and I studied the previous exams quite thoroughly, and I was actually feeling almost confident going into the exam, but that was dashed pretty soon after the beginning of perusal.</p>
<p>The exam had a couple of similar questions, yes, but some of the unfamiliar questions were just plain uncalled for. Not only were they completely different to past questions, they weren&#8217;t recognisable&nbsp;from lecture notes or tutorial questions we had studied either.&nbsp;This was all compounded by the fact that the lecturers hadn&#8217;t given any good indications of what to expect to be on the exam in the first place.</p>
<p>So needless to say, that I was incredibly unimpressed and frankly just plain angry after leaving the exam. What makes this all the more frustrating is that if the course was designed and run better, it would have been really interesting and useful stuff to learn. Things I would like to see changed are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase the weighting of Assignments and Practicals</li>
<li>Reduce the weighting of the Final Exam and/or make the Final Exam open book.</li>
</ul>
<p>Closed book exams are, in my opinion at the very least, outdated, irrelevant&nbsp;and unrealistic - especially for engineering. When will I ever, as a practicing engineer, be required to remember 600 slides of information and be expected to design or solve a problem without access to reference material? So why, then, are engineering students being subjected to exams with such unrealistic conditions? Shouldn&#8217;t exams test the understanding of subject matter and the students ability to solve problems, rather than&nbsp;regurgitate&nbsp;the contents of lecture slides and struggle to remember formulas?</p>
<p>Obviously, my opinions on this matter are rather biased. But I dont think that makes them invalid. Please feel free to leave comments here - I am very curious to know what other opinions exist.</p></div>
