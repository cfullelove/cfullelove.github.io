<div data-src="v5"><p style="text-align: justify;">There is a new jail-breaking tool in the wild. It&#8217;s called <a href="http://www.jailbreakme.com">JailBreakMe 2.0</a>. In the wake of the <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/btl/eff-liberates-iphone-jailbreakers-does-it-matter/37174?tag=mantle_skin;content">legalisation of jail-breaking</a> of iPhones in the US, this tool really makes jail-breaking your iPhone <em>scarily </em>easy - <em>you don&#8217;t even need your computer</em>. What is more, it works on the recently released (in Australia anyway) iPhone 4!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">JailBreakMe 2.0 works by using a pretty serious security flaw in the Safari web browser that allows&nbsp;arbitrary&nbsp;code execution using PDFs. Meaning, the flaw allows websites that use this exploit to run code <em>they</em> have written on <em>your</em> iPhone.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jail-breaking is pretty smart use of the security hole, but it definitely opens the door for more sinister applications. For instance, a malicious person could use the same method to gain access to all the information on your iPhone - arbitrary code execution is basically free reign to do <em>anything. </em>And realistically, there is no&nbsp;guarantee&nbsp;that JailBreakMe doesn&#8217;t steal information in the process of jail-breaking and installing the required software.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I would urge anyone who is considering using this method to be careful and most definitely <span style="text-decoration: underline;">BACK UP FIRST</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As many of you know, I&#8217;m really not the fond of my current phone (iPhone 3G) so I thought I would try it out. Here&#8217;s how it works.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Firstly, enter the url: <strong>www.jailbreakme.com</strong> into Safari on your iPhone.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="thumbnail-image-block ssNonEditable"><span><a href="javascript:Y.Squarespace.Utils.lightboxAsset('50616267e4b09bed8049af41');"><img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50616230c4aaf3a25087208f/50616266e4b09bed8049ae97/50616267e4b09bed8049af3d/1280914582053/#img.jpg.Utils.lightboxAsset('50616267e4b09bed8049af42');"><img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50616230c4aaf3a25087208f/50616266e4b09bed8049ae97/50616267e4b09bed8049af3e/1280914675543/#img.jpg.Utils.lightboxAsset('50616267e4b09bed8049af43');"><img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50616230c4aaf3a25087208f/50616266e4b09bed8049ae97/50616267e4b09bed8049af3f/1280914804076/#img.jpg.com.au/images?q=jailbreakme&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;hl=en&amp;tab=wi&amp;biw=1679&amp;bih=898">elsewhere</a>&nbsp;[Google].</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is the final result. The Cydia application is installed along with the jail-break. The &#8220;Backgrounder&#8221; app is something I have installed out of the new, exciting and non-approved repository now open to me. It is allowing me to multitask even though I only have an iPhone 3G - but thats the basis of another post.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="thumbnail-image-block ssNonEditable"><span><a href="javascript:Y.Squarespace.Utils.lightboxAsset('50616267e4b09bed8049af44');"><img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50616230c4aaf3a25087208f/50616266e4b09bed8049ae97/50616267e4b09bed8049af40/1280914986383/#img.jpg">previous adventures</a> its performing well. iOS 4 does seem to break MyWi though, so I haven&#8217;t been able to tether my iPad yet. I encourage anyone who is bored or and that has no important information on their iPhone to give this a shot, but obviously I also advise extreme caution! If you have had any experience with this jail-break, or any questions, please post comments.</p>
