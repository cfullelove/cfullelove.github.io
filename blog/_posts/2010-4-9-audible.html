<div data-src="v5"><p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"></span><br/><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><div style="text-align: justify;">As I have mentioned in previous posts, I work for Queensland Main Roads in Nerang. I live in Brisbane, so this unfortunately means that on the days I work (3 per week) I have to drive an hour each way. The trip also has the disadvantage of crossing radio broadcast areas. That is, I start listening to a station in Brisbane and half way to Nerang it looses reception. Thankfully, around the time I started at QMR, I discovered&nbsp;<a href="http://www.audible.com/">Audible</a>.</div></span><br/><div style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br/></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><a href="http://www.audible.com/">Audible</a>&nbsp;is an online audiobook store owned by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>. I was first exposed to it when listening to Leo Laporte's <a href="http://twit.tv/twig">TWiG</a> and <a href="http://twit.tv/">TWiT</a> podcasts, of which Audible are sponsors. In the podcasts, the various participants recommend several books that have read (listened to) using the Audible service. I was intrigued, and decided to investigate this further, especially since I knew I was going to be doing alot of driving.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br/></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">I used the promo-code advertised on TWiT, and got a&nbsp;Platinum&nbsp;Membership. This entitles me to two "credits" per month (usually two books), and costs me $22.95 per month. They have a fairly extensive library, according to advertisements they have 70,000 titles. Sadly, however, I'm not sure how many of those are available in the Australian store. When trying to buy books recommended by the TWiT/TWiG hosts I found some were not available to me.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br/></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Taking advantage of the trial I had signed up for, I looked around and found a few potentially interesting books. Two of them I bought:</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><ul><li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><a href="http://www.audible.com/adbl/site/products/ProductDetail.jsp?productID=BK_DOVE_000221&amp;BV_UseBVCookie=Yes">A Brief History in Time</a> by Steven Hawking - This book is superbly narrated and delves into the history of our knowledge of the universe, all the way from Galileo to recent times. It is written in layman's terms, but probably aimed at those already interested in the field. Like me - I liked it alot!</span></li><li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><a href="http://www.audible.com/adbl/site/products/ProductDetail.jsp?productID=BK_HARP_001794&amp;BV_UseBVCookie=Yes">What Would Google Do?</a> by Jeff Jarvis - I've mentioned Jeff Jarvis on this site before as he is one of the host of TWiG. This book had a profound impact on me starting this blog. Jarvis explores the history of the internet, how Google impacted the internet, how other companies could or have taken a leaf out of Google's book. Very good read with lots of quite interesting sub-stories.</span></li></ul><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">I am currently reading <a href="http://www.audible.com/adbl/site/products/ProductDetail.jsp?productID=BK_RHAU_000109&amp;BV_UseBVCookie=Yes">Linked</a> by Alberto-Laszlo Barabasi. Another academically slanted book, it explores the history of network theory and its links to complex systems. I have yet to finish it (its 8hrs long), but thus far it is pretty good. I did find it a <i>little</i>&nbsp;dry at the beginning, but it has definitely picked up pace.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br/></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">There are a few books on my "Wish List", a list of books I would like to read but have yet to purchase.</span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://s3.media.squarespace.com/production/568770/6566610/_W2EsZMz0_ok/S78g0uWeqJI/AAAAAAAAADE/y1xwjXNi9uw/s320/audible_wishlist.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="312" src="http://s3.media.squarespace.com/production/568770/6566610/_W2EsZMz0_ok/S78g0uWeqJI/AAAAAAAAADE/y1xwjXNi9uw/s320/audible_wishlist.png" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">(Click for Larger Version)</span></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">I will be sure to blog about these as I read them. I have around 6 hours of driving time a week, so I&nbsp;theoretically&nbsp;could get through 2-3 books each month.</span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br/></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">I do suggest giving <a href="http://www.audible.com/">Audible</a> a go, and hope you get the same satisfaction I have from it.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br/></span></div></div></p></div>
