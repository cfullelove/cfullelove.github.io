I am a Distracted Engineer from Brisbane, Australia. This is my website. I am intensely interested in the new and exciting innovations occurring everywhere on the Internet, the technology behind it, and ultimately the people that are behind the technology. My dream is to one day be one of those people.

I have a formal educational background in Electrical Engineering, but I am also a programmer on the side experience in various languages and platforms. I greatly enjoy building things in code, and hope one day to make a living out of that.
