<div data-src="v5"><p>If you were present for the explosion of SPAM on Facebook a few minutes ago. Here is really quickly how they did it.</p>
<p>Firstly, it looks like the exploiters take advantage of the face that Javascript is not check in the &#8220;feed_info&#8221; field of a Facebook Wall Post. This meant that everyone who clicked &#8220;Remove This App&#8221; actually ran some hidden Javascript which perpetuated the SPAM.</p>
<p>Here is the code some of you unknowingly ran.</p>

<p>In the future, check the &#8220;Status Bar&#8221; of your browser and make sure that links don&#8217;t look suspicious!</p>
<p>Looks like Facebook got on top of this pretty quickly too. Good work to them!</p></div>
