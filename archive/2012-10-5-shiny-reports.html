<p>Recently <a href="http://redbook.me">redbook.me</a> got a cool new feature - reports! This is something that I’ve wanted to include for a while in the product, but hadn’t due to the difficulty of implementing it on the old architecture. With the new backend, however, implementing new features has been really fast so; reports!</p><img src="{{ site.path }}/assets/2012-10-5-shiny-reports/1349420320928.png" /><p>For now I’ve only built one report but I think its one of the more important ones - the labour cost trend. This allows managers/owners to look at how the weekly labour costs is trending over time. This is a very useful tool that allows identification of labour usage patterns that might not be otherwise evident - especially if you are tracking it against gross earnings. It can be helpful when building new rosters also, as it helps gauge the consistency with previous weeks.</p>

<p>Some of the reports I’d like to build in the near future are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Average Labour Cost by day of the week - this will show the average relative cost of labour between each day of the week.</p></li>
<li><p>Rostered Hours Trend Report - similar to the labour cost trend report, but using hours instead of cost</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In this section I’ll give a quick overview of how the reports were implemented.</p>

<p>For presentation of the charts, I used the Google Charts API. Implementing the charts was fairly simple but it’s clear that there is a lot functionality offered that I have yet to take advantage of ;-). While I’m going to try not to put charts everywhere, I think there is room for their use in a number parts of redbook.me.</p>
