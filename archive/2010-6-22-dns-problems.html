<div data-src="v5"><p style="text-align: justify;">Hopefully no one really noticed, but there was an issue with the distractedengineer.com domain name in the last couple of days. It meant that typing &#8220;www.distractedenginer.com&#8221; or &#8220;distractedenginer.com&#8221; didn&#8217;t take you here.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The problem was cause due to strange internal issues with the DNS hosting service I was using, <a href="http://www.xname.org">XName.org</a>. I wasn&#8217;t able to fix the issue with XName, but managed to get everything back up and running by using my registrar&#8217;s DNS management service.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If anyone know of any <em>good </em>and&nbsp;free DNS hosting services, please leave a note in the comments. And before anyone asks, yes I wish I could be hosting my own DNS&#8230;</p></div>
