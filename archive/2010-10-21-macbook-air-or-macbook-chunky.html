<div data-src="v5"><p>Apple <a href="http://www.apple.com/apple-events/october-2010/">announced yesterday</a> that they will be selling a new version of the <a href="http://www.apple.com/au/macbookair/">Macbook Air</a>.</p>
<p>The new Macbook Air is a very cool device in my opinion. Spawned from Apple&#8217;s current &#8220;Back to the Mac&#8221; theme, it brings some of the interesting features from the iPad into the laptop space.</p>
<p>The <em>best</em>&nbsp;feature, in my opinion, is the price. It sells (available now) for AU $1,199+ in either an 11.3 or 13.1 inch form factor. As you may remember, the pervious Macbook Air was hellishly expensive an not even close to a cool as this one.</p>
<p>What is interesting about the price point, though, is that is starts <em>exactly </em>the same as the current Macbook. The plain boring &#8220;chunky white&#8221; one. Here is the comparison:</p>

<p>So I guess the question is, how do you decide? The Macbook Air is not nearly as powerful, but is super light and fully aluminium with flash memory etc. The Macbook (plain) has almost twice the processor power, several times the harddrive space, a optical drive and is just a bit&#8230; thicker. Is the shiny new goodness worth the performance hit?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m curious to know what others think, so please leave comments.</p></div>
