<div data-src="v5"><p style="text-align: justify;">Almost everyone I know uses Facebook. Facebook is a powerful tool for keeping in touch and sharing parts of our lives. There are problems with Facebook though, and it has really come into focus over the last couple of months. Sadly, not everyone is aware of these issues. I am a Facebook user - and I think using it has value - but I strongly urge people to be careful.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Privacy is the big, and topical, problem with Facebook today. For the most part, users are vaguely aware that there may or may not be something to worry about in terms of the information they share. But in some circles - I&#8217;ll use the stereotypes &#8220;nerds&#8221;, &#8220;techies&#8221;, &#8220;geeks&#8221; or &#8220;web savvy&#8221; - people have noticed that there really is something to be worried about. Many of these people, eg <a href="http://twit.tv">Leo Laporte</a>, have gone so far as to deactivate or ever <em>delete </em>their Facebook accounts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Facebook users are not easily made aware of <em>if</em> or <em>how</em> their information is shared, largely due to the frequent changes in Facebook privacy policy. That is, the defaults on whether information about you or something you shared is public or private changes all the time; seemingly always is the <em>public </em>direction. <a href="http://mattmckeon.com/facebook-privacy/">The Evolution of Privacy on Facebook</a>&nbsp;really shows how these defaults have changed over time - its a little scary.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But, as I said before, Facebook is still a massively attractive and useful service. For many people, the amount of effort required to leave Facebook is a powerful enough reason not to. This is something I struggle with also, and likely I will not leave Facebook because of it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One possible solution to this problem is to become a Facebook Privacy Settings Ninja. While this is definitely possible, it requires almost more effort than just deleting your account.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another solution - and this is the solution I try to use - is to treat Facebook as <em>entirely public</em>. This means you should treat anything you post, whether it be status updates, photos, phone numbers, etc, as if publicly available on the front page of Google (this is not that much of an over statement!). The hope is that if you assume everything is public, you are less likely to get caught out sharing something you will regret.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The notion of treating everything as public is basically the same as you would view posting something on a service like Twitter. And perhaps the reason that Twitter is not really thought of as &#8220;evil&#8221; is because it was always public. Facebook, on the otherhand, began as a mostly private service and gradually became more public <em>without properly informing its users</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hopefully, if enough people become used to thinking of Facebook as a public domain, we may even see a little more&nbsp;discretion&nbsp;in how people behave when using it. We all see comments and posts that we are sure would be better left unshared.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once again, I don&#8217;t necessarily believe deleting your Facebook account is the answer - especially when there really aren&#8217;t any good alternatives out there. But I do urge everyone to be that little bit more careful about how they use Facebook. With the amount of information everyone is sharing these days, it becomes very hard to keep track. And you don&#8217;t want to come back and bite you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As always, I welcome comments!</p>
