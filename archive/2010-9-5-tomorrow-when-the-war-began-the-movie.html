<p style="text-align: left;">I just got back from seeing the new Aussie film &#8220;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1456941/">Tomorrow When the War Began</a>&#8221; based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Marsden_(writer)">John Marsden</a> book of the same name. I am a very big fan of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomorrow_series">Tomorrow Series</a>&nbsp;having read - or more accurately listened to - all seven of the books. To be honest, I went into the cinema worried they might not do a very good job. But now, I think the job they have done is fantastic.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The movie is based on the first book in the Tomorrow Series, and follows a bunch of Australian teens through a pretty amazing story. Here is the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com">IMDB</a> synopsis:</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;"><em>Based on the first of seven books by acclaimed Australian author, John Marsden, Tomorrow When The War Began is the story of seven teenagers who return from a week-long camping trip to find that Australia has been invaded by a foreign power.<br /><br />Banding together to fight gurellia-style agaist the enemy, this is not a typical heroic war movie - it is a terrifying situation where they must sometimes use little more than a knife or a belt to murder a soldier in cold blood. It&#8217;s a graphic tale of the violence, the blood, the fear, and the insanity of war.<br /><br />These kids are underdogs, they&#8217;re not going to win the war, they&#8217;re more likely to end up dead in a ditch than send the enemy retreating, but it&#8217;s their land, their parents and friends in prison camps. They give a damn and they&#8217;d rather die fighting than give up.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Something that made me nervous about this film was that it is an Australian production with Australian actors. And while I am all for Australian film in principal, I didn&#8217;t want to be.. well.. crap. Thankfully this definitely wasn&#8217;t the case in my opinion - even with cast members from Neighbours and Home and Away.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The movie took me completely by surprise - shocked me with its intensity - but I won&#8217;t say too much more lest I spoil it. I really liked how I recognised heaps of quotes from dialogue appearing in the text. The cast too, I thought, did quite well and fitted well with how I pictured them to be when reading the books.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There were a couple of things I wasn&#8217;t wild about. I wish they could have delved deeper into the emotions of the group members a bit more. In the book a <em>lot </em>of time is spent describing the thoughts and feelings of the characters in between all the action - a big part of the story deals with the utter horror of war. Also, I&#8217;m not sure how easy the movie would have been to follow if I had not read the book previously. I would love comments from those who haven&#8217;t read the book to see what they thought.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you have read any of the Tomorrow Series books I strongly suggest you go see this movie - you will love it. If you haven&#8217;t I still think you will enjoy it a lot - perhaps even persuade you to read the books. Very keen to hear what others thought about this film.
