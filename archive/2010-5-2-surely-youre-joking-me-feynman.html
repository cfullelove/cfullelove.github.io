<p style="text-align: justify;">Yet another book I recently finished that I would like to review a little is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surely_You're_Joking,_Mr._Feynman!">&#8220;Surely You&#8217;re Joking Mr Feynman!&#8221;</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman">Richard P. Feynman</a>. This book was nothing like I expected. As Feynman was a very well known and successful physicist, I expected this book to be far more physics based. Instead, it consisted of a collection of incredibly interesting personal stories throughout Feynman&#8217;s life. Obviously some of these stories did relate to physics, but the physical concepts weren&#8217;t the point of these stories.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On reading this book, I discovered there is a lot more to Richard Feynman than I had originally realised. Feynman discusses his involvement in the atomic bomb&#8217;s development, the various universities he attended and taught at, his exploits in Brazil, adventures with girls, music, art and philosophy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Feynman came across as an incredibly interesting and, at times, hilarious character. A number of his stories proved to be very thought provoking too. This was largely due to Feynman&#8217;s very unique point of view in life. Even stories that would otherwise had been quite dull, were made interesting, funny even, by viewing it from his interesting angle.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once again, I listened to this book as an audiobook from <a href="http://www.audible.com">Audible.com</a>. While I did find the stories in the book very interesting by themselves, I did find that they were a little disjointed. I couldn&#8217;t follow the stories in a distinct chronological order. This didn&#8217;t detract to much from the experience, but it was definitely noticable for me, and for a few reviewers that posted on Audible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I do recommend this book to anyone interested in science in general as well as just a good read and a good laugh. I thank Eloise King-Smith for recommending I read this book, was definitely worth it.</p></div>
