<div data-src="v5"><p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;ve mentioned several times books that I have read (listened to) from Audible.com. Since signing up for their&nbsp;Platinum&nbsp;account, I&#8217;ve gone through 12 books in under 2.5 months. I am a very big fan of this service, and I have decided to become an Audible.com affiliate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Being an affiliate means that I will be able to put Audible.com links on this site, and get a small amount of credit for any sales that result. I am NOT going to be cramming ads into every viewable portion of the site - I still want people to come and read my blog.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My plan is this:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have added a link to Audible.com in the right-hand sidebar, which you should be able to see. This links to Audible.com&#8217;s Gold Membership signup page. For a monthly fee, you receive credits for 1 book per month, plus get discounted prices on any book you purchase on top of that. It&#8217;s a very good deal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to the sidebar link, every book I write about from now on, I&#8217;ll put a link down the bottom where you can purchase it.</p>
<p>Here is a link to the last book I wrote about, as an example:</p>

<p>That is the extent that I will be using Audible.com advertising. I don&#8217;t think that it will degrade the experience of reading this blog - in fact I hope it will actually improve it. I welcome any comments you have on this.</p></div>
