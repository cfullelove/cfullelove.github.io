<div data-src="v5"><p style="text-align: justify;">Anyone that reads this blog is aware that I am a pretty big fan of <a href="http://www.audible.com">Audible.com</a>. I have read around 23 of their books equating to over a&nbsp;<em>week</em>&nbsp;of continuous listening. For a short while Audible has had a <a href="http://www.audible.com/adbl/store/audibleAir.jsp?BV_UseBVCookie=Yes">mobile app</a> for the <a href="http://www.android.com/">Android Platform</a>&nbsp;in beta (or so I have heard anyway). But now, Audible have (finally) released an <a href="http://www.audible.com/adbl/store/audibleAir.jsp?BV_UseBVCookie=Yes&amp;os=ip">iPhone version</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">When I first downloaded the App, I did have a few issues with the download speed. I took <em>forever </em>to download the first part of a new book. But I did find out that was a server side issue (and not specific to the iPhone App) that has now apparently been resolved. One other issue I did find though was that on my phone (a piddly iPhone 3G) the app ran kinda slow - ie I had to wait a few seconds to change screens etc. While it wasn&#8217;t a deal breaker, it wasn&#8217;t as good an experience that I had hoped for.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I have put the app through an hour long journey to work and it performed really well. One really great feature it has is that the book will start playing 20 seconds or so before the point you last listened. This is really good for reminding you what was happening.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I do feel this app has been and will be a positive experience with the Audible service, and I highly recommend it to anyone else who uses Audible. Please feel free to ask any questions or leave comments below!</p></div>
